Total WordPress Theme Tweaker
###

Example plugin for tweaking the Total WordPress theme via hooks and filters instead of using a Child theme.

This is just a generic example for WordPress beginners to help them get started.
Child themes are generally better and easier to manage but if for some reason you don't want to use a child theme it's better to use a plugin to tweak the theme, then to tweak it manually because whenever you tweak a theme manually you will lose your edits when you update the theme.
